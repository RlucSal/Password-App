# Password-App

## Description 

### Develop a password application that satisties the following  acceptable criteria:
1.  Generate a password when the button is clicked
2.  Present a series of prompts for password criteria
   - Length of password: At least 8 characters but no more than 128
   - Character types: Lowercase, Uppercase, Numeric, Special characters 
3. Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
4. Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page


### Motivation 

1. Security: Passwords are a critical aspect of online security. Weak or easily guessable passwords can lead to security breaches, unauthorized access, and data theft. A password generator helps create strong, random, and unique passwords, which are much more secure than those that can be easily guessed.

2. Password Complexity: Security guidelines often recommend using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in passwords to make them harder to crack. Manually creating such complex passwords can be challenging and time-consuming, making a password generator a valuable tool.

3. Avoiding Common Passwords: Password generators help users avoid using common, easily guessable passwords like "password," "123456," or "qwerty." Such passwords are frequently targeted by attackers.

4. Password Manager Integration: Many password generators work in conjunction with password management tools. These tools can store and auto-fill generated passwords for users, simplifying the process of managing and using complex passwords.

5. Efficiency: Creating strong passwords manually can be a cumbersome task, especially when multiple passwords are needed for different accounts and services. Password generators can quickly produce unique passwords for various purposes.

6. Randomness: A good password generator ensures randomness in password creation, which is essential for security. Humans often struggle to create truly random passwords, and password generators fill this gap.

7. Password Recovery and Reset: Users who forget their passwords or need to reset them can use password generators to create new, strong passwords without having to rely on their memory or use easily guessed patterns.

8. Compliance and Best Practices: For businesses and organizations, using password generators may be required to comply with security regulations and industry best practices. They can demonstrate a commitment to robust security measures.

## Usage

1. Access a Password Generator
2. Start by setting the desired length for your password. Longer passwords are generally more secure
3. Choose the character types you want in your password. 
4. Click the "Generate" button, and the password generator will create a random and secure password based on your preferences.
5. Review the Password:
6. The generated password will be displayed on the screen. Review it to ensure it meets your requirements and appears secure.
7. Copy or Save the Password
